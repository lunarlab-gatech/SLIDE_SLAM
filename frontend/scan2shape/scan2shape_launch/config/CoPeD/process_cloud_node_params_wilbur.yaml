# Description: Parameters for the process_cloud_node_outdoor.py file

#------------------Important Parameters START------------------
# threshold for segmented lidar points range in meters
valid_range_threshold: 200.0
# expected segmentation frequency in Hz
expected_segmentation_frequency: 2.0
# Minimum time in seconds to track a cuboid for before cuboid fitting
time_to_initialize_cuboid: 3.0
# TODO(ankit): Change the use_1st_layer_clustering param names to something more intuitive
# DBSCAN parameters for clustering the segmented point cloud
# The first layer of clustering is done to throw away small noisy points. Hence the parameters need to be conservative
# The second layer of clustering is done to cluster the remaining points into objects. Hence the parameters can be more aggressive

# Flag to determine whether to estimate facing direction of car by comparing front and rear heights
estimate_facing_dir_car: False
# Flag to determine whether to cluster and fix cuboid orientation by taking a consensus of the orientations of the cuboids in the cluster

#------------------Important Parameters END------------------

ransac_n_points: 50
# the height above the ground plane to consider a point as an object point. All points below this height are considered as ground points and not used for object fitting
ground_median_increment: 0.25
# use simulator or run on real robot data. SHOULD ALWAYS BE FALSE for running on real robot data
use_sim: False
# visualize all cuboid instances (keep track of all and never remove tracks), should be set as False unless debugging
track_always_visualize: False
# Cuboid dim threshold used to start initial object tracking process
fit_cuboid_dim_thresh: 0.5
# Resolution to perform voxel downsampling for accumulated instance point cloud. -1 means no downsample
